# The Python print() function is often used to output variables.

x = "Python is awesome"
print(x);

# In the print() function, you output multiple variables, separated by a comma:

x = "Python"
y = "is"
z = "awesome"
print(x, y, z)

# You can also use the + operator to output multiple variables:

x = "Python "
y = "is "
z = "awesome"
print(x + y + z)

# For numbers, the + character works as a mathematical operator:

x = 5
y = 10
print(x + y)

# In the print() function, when you try to combine a string and a number with the + operator, Python will give you an
# error:

x = 5
y = "John"
# print(x + y) # TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'str'

# The best way to output multiple variables in the print() function is to separate them with commas,
# which even support different data types:

x = 5
y = "John"
print(x, y)
