"""
Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable.

Lists are one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are Tuple, Set, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.

Lists are created using square brackets:
"""

mylist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

print(mylist)

# List items are ordered, changeable, and allow duplicate values.
# List items are indexed, the first item has index [0], the second item has index [1] etc.

"""
When we say that lists are ordered, it means that the items have a defined order, and that order will not change.

If you add new items to a list, the new items will be placed at the end of the list.

Note: There are some list methods that will change the order, but in general: the order of the items will not change.
"""
# Lists allow duplicate values:

thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "apple", "cherry"]
print(thislist)

# To determine how many items a list has, use the len() function:

thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(len(thislist))

# List items can be of any data type:

list1 = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
list2 = [1, 5, 7, 9, 3]
list3 = [True, False, False]



# A list with strings, integers and boolean values:

list4 = ["abc", 34, True, 40, "male"]

print(list4)
