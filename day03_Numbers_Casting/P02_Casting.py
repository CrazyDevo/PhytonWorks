"""

There may be times when you want to specify a type on to a variable. This can be done with casting. Python is an object-orientated language, and as such it uses classes to define data types, including its primitive types.

Casting in python is therefore done using constructor functions:

int() - constructs an integer number from an integer literal, a float literal (by removing all decimals), or a string literal (providing the string represents a whole number)
float() - constructs a float number from an integer literal, a float literal or a string literal (providing the string represents a float or an integer)
str() - constructs a string from a wide variety of data types, including strings, integer literals and float literals

x = int(1)  # x will be 1
y = int(2.8)  # y will be 2
z = int("3")  # z will be 3

a = float(1)  # x will be 1.0
b = float(2.8)  # y will be 2.8
c = float("3")  # z will be 3.0
d = float("4.2")  # w will be 4.2

e = str("s1")  # x will be 's1'
f = str(2)  # y will be '2'
g = str(3.0)  # z will be '3.0'
