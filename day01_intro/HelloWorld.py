#Comments starts with a #, and Python will ignore them:
#Python does not really have a syntax for multiline comments.
#To add a multiline comment you could insert a # for each line:
#print("Hello World");

"""
Since Python will ignore string literals that are not assigned to a variable,
you can add a multiline string (triple quotes) in your code, and place your comment inside it:
This is a comment
written in
more than just one line
